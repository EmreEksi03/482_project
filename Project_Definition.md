Project Definition Document
• Project Name:
Micro Goal Tracker

• Project Summary:
MicroGoal is a lightweight Android productivity application that helps users set and track small, daily personal goals—also known as micro-goals. These goals can include simple habits like "drink 2L of water," "stretch for 5 minutes," or "write 100 words."

The app aims to help users build consistency and maintain motivation by visualizing progress with streaks, completion stats, and historical summaries. It solves the common problem of goal-setting apps being too complex for simple daily habits.

• Objectives:

Enable users to register, log in, and manage accounts securely via Firebase Authentication.

Add, edit, and delete daily micro-goals.

Track goal completion with visual indicators (e.g., streaks, checkmarks, progress bars).

View goal progress history and streak summaries.

Send daily reminders to encourage habit formation.

Store and retrieve goal data persistently.

Provide a simple and distraction-free interface.
