Project Definition Document
• Project Name:
MicroGoal

• Project Summary:
MicroGoal is a lightweight productivity application that helps users set and track small, daily personal goals—also known as micro-goals. These goals can include simple habits like "drink 2L of water," "stretch for 5 minutes," or "write 100 words."
The app aims to help users build consistency and maintain motivation by visualizing progress with streaks and completion stats. It solves the common problem of goal-setting apps being too complex for simple daily habits.

Enable users to add, edit, and delete daily micro-goals.

Track goal completion with visual indicators (e.g., streaks, checkmarks).

Send daily reminders to encourage habit formation.
